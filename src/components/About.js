          Graduated in Chemistry and so passionate about science that I have
          dedicated myself to transmitting this enthusiasm to others through
          different classes, helping people in subjects such as mathematics,
          chemistry, physics... From this exchange of knowledge, which has
          recently become more technological, my curiosity to discover new
          alternatives was born and I fell fully into the world of programming.
          Especially on the front-end part where I can use my creativity.
